# gait-time-series-analysis

Undergrad Research with Professor Hsieh

Collected running gait data on self using six sensors, will aim to eventually apply analysis tools that I learned from other running data to gain insights on my own running gait

Analyzed other sensor data provided by Fushing's PhD student, Xi, to practice data visualization and analysis first:
- plotting accelerometer and gyroscope data
- performing hierarchical clustering
- digital-coding state sequences to see how it evolves over time
- landmark partitioning by using algorithm to determine landmarks and cycle start times
- visualize single and multiple gait cycles with concentric circles and cylinders
